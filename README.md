### Introduction

This repo is meant to contain </b>any language</b> scripts which can basically ease our lives. Some of the roles of these scripts might be the following:
* Automation
* Downloader
* Algorithm Implementation
* Game
* Chatbots and such many more

### Procedure to add programs:

- Since all are collaborators, you just need to upload the file for ease and after you upload, instead of committing directly to `main`, you just need to <b>create a new branch</b> and a new PR there onwards.

Alternatively,

- Clone the repo to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/6-CSE/PyHack.git`
(Before committing all files, check if all files are staged atleast. It can be checked using `git status`).
- Make a new branch to make PR: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
- Add your programs in correct locations: `git add .` (Adds all files here)
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Some_Commit_Message"`. (Committed all files)
- Finally, you just need to push all the changes by doing: `git push origin <branch_name>`. 

### Decorum

Please check some of the examples of the already created scripts and their formats. To maintain uniformity, please follow similar pattern and format while pushing/PR'ing your code.

Now, come to this repo and you will find an option to push and make new PR for the changes you made just now. Make a PR and add atleast one of us as your reviewers.
